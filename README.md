# EDIT: RB

This repo contains some changes that allows to build and run the engine in 64 bit mode with VS 2017 on Windows 10.
I use this repo for merging stuff back into RBDOOM-3-BFG.

The readme below is outdated concerning the Build instructions.

NOTE: unfortunately the README that came with our copy of the library has
been lost, so the one from release 6b is included instead. There are a few
'glue type' modifications to the library to make it easier to use from

better release of the library.
