===============================================================================

Decals are lightweight primitives for bullet / blood marks on static
geometry. Decals with common materials will be merged together, but
additional decals will be allocated as needed. The material should not
be one that receives lighting, because no interactions are generated
for these lightweight surfaces.

FIXME:	Decals on models in portalled off areas do not get freed
until the area becomes visible again.
